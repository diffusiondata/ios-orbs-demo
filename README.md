# Native Orbs Demo for iOS

A demonstration subscribing to the topic tree created by the JavaScript Orbs Demo which is available
to run by default in the [Reappt](https://www.reappt.io/)&trade; dashboard.

Written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
and enabled using the
[Diffusion Apple API](https://developer.reappt.io/docs/apple/),
this demo renders smoothly animating updates to Orbs using the
[UIKit framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/).

## Running the Demo

Before loading the project in Xcode you will need to download the `Diffusion.framework` and put it in
the `Frameworks` folder.

The latest version of the SDK can be downloaded from:<br />
[https://developer.reappt.io/clients/apple/](http://developer.reappt.io/clients/apple/)

Requires Xcode 7.3 or higher as the code relies on language features fixed in Swift 2.2.

Tested against Diffusion 5.7.
